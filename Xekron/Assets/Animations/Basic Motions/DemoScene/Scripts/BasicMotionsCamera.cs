WARNING: This script is intended for demonstration purposes only. 
You may modify it as needed, but note that it was designed to work across multiple projects 
with different configurations. As a result, it is not optimized for performance (for example,
it does not use Layers or Tags for Physics queries in order to avoid conflicts or add
innecessary Layers/Tags to your project).

This script is needed for the "BasicMotionsCharacterController.cs" script to work properly.

This script controls the camera zoom, camera collision and camera vertical tilt.
